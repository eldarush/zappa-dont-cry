Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we've found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.

This work is the result of [many authors and translators](AUTHORS.md).
Some of this
[originally](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands)
[appeared](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix)
on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know),
but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements.

## Meta

Scope:

- This guide is for both beginners and experienced users. The goals are *breadth* (everything important), *specificity* (give concrete examples of the most common case), and *brevity* (avoid things that aren't essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere). Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives.
- This is written for Linux, with the exception of the "[macOS only](#macos-only)" and "[Windows only](#windows-only)" sections. Many of the other items apply or can be installed on other Unices or macOS (or even Cygwin).
- The focus is on interactive Bash, though many tips apply to other shells and to general Bash scripting.
- It includes both "standard" Unix commands as well as ones that require special package installs -- so long as they are important enough to merit inclusion.

Notes:

- To keep this to one page, content is implicitly included by reference. You're smart enough to look up more detail elsewhere once you know the idea or command to Google. Use `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `pip` or `brew` (as appropriate) to install new programs.
- Use [Explainshell](http://explainshell.com/) to get a helpful breakdown of what commands, options, pipes etc. do.


## Basics

- Learn basic Bash. Actually, type `man bash` and at least skim the whole thing; it's pretty easy to follow and not that long. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash is powerful and always available (learning *only* zsh, fish, etc., while tempting on your own laptop, restricts you in many situations, such as using existing servers).

- Learn at least one text-based editor well. The `nano` editor is one of the simplest for basic editing (opening, editing, saving, searching). However, for the power user in a text terminal, there is no substitute for Vim (`vi`), the hard-to-learn but venerable, fast, and full-featured editor. Many people also use the classic Emacs, particularly for larger editing tasks. (Of course, any modern software developer working on an extensive project is unlikely to use only a pure text-based editor and should also be familiar with modern graphical IDEs and tools.)

- Finding documentation:
  - Know how to read official documentation with `man` (for the inquisitive, `man man` lists the section numbers, e.g. 1 is "regular" commands, 5 is files/conventions, and 8 are for administration). Find man pages with `apropos`.
  - Know that some commands are not executables, but Bash builtins, and that you can get help on them with `help` and `help -d`. You can find out whether a command is an executable, shell builtin or an alias by using `type command`.
  - `curl cheat.sh/command` will give a brief "cheat sheet" with common examples of how to use a shell command.

- Learn about redirection of output and input using `>` and `<` and pipes using `|`. Know `>` overwrites the output file and `>>` appends. Learn about stdout and stderr.

- Learn about file glob expansion with `*` (and perhaps `?` and `[`...`]`) and quoting and the difference between double `"` and single `'` quotes. (See more on variable expansion below.)

- Be familiar with Bash job management: `&`, **ctrl-z**, **ctrl-c**, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`, etc.

- Know `ssh`, and the basics of passwordless authentication, via `ssh-agent`, `ssh-add`, etc.

- Basic file management: `ls` and `ls -l` (in particular, learn what every column in `ls -l` means), `less`, `head`, `tail` and `tail -f` (or even better, `less +F`), `ln` and `ln -s` (learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links), `chown`, `chmod`, `du` (for a quick summary of disk usage: `du -hs *`). For filesystem management, `df`, `mount`, `fdisk`, `mkfs`, `lsblk`. Learn what an inode is (`ls -i` or `df -i`).

- Basic network management: `ip` or `ifconfig`, `dig`, `traceroute`, `route`.

- Learn and use a version control management system, such as `git`.

- Know regular expressions well, and the various flags to `grep`/`egrep`. The `-i`, `-o`, `-v`, `-A`, `-B`, and `-C` options are worth knowing.

- Learn to use `apt-get`, `yum`, `dnf` or `pacman` (depending on distro) to find and install packages. And make sure you have `pip` to install Python-based command-line tools (a few below are easiest to install via `pip`).


## Everyday use

- In Bash, use **Tab** to complete arguments or list all available commands and **ctrl-r** to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press **ctrl-r** repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press **Enter** to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).

- In Bash, use **ctrl-w** to delete the last word, and **ctrl-u** to delete the content from current cursor back to the start of the line. Use **alt-b** and **alt-f** to move by word, **ctrl-a** to move cursor to beginning of line,  **ctrl-e** to move cursor to end of line, **ctrl-k** to kill to the end of the line, **ctrl-l** to clear the screen. See `man readline` for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example **alt-.** cycles through previous arguments, and **alt-*** expands a glob.


- Alternatively, if you love vi-style key-bindings, use `set -o vi` (and `set -o emacs` to put it back).

- For editing long commands, after setting your editor (for example `export EDITOR=vim`), **ctrl-x** **ctrl-e** will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing. Or in vi style, **escape-v**.

- To see recent commands, use `history`. Follow with `!n` (where `n` is the command number) to execute again. There are also many abbreviations you can use, the most useful probably being `!$` for last argument and `!!` for last command (see "HISTORY EXPANSION" in the man page). However, these are often easily replaced with **ctrl-r** and **alt-.**.

- Go to your home directory with `cd`. Access files relative to your home directory with the `~` prefix (e.g. `~/.bashrc`). In `sh` scripts refer to the home directory as `$HOME`.

- To go back to the previous working directory: `cd -`.

- If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind, hit **alt-#** to add a `#` at the beginning and enter it as a comment (or use **ctrl-a**, **#**, **enter**). You can then return to it later via command history.

- Use `xargs` (or `parallel`). It's very powerful. Note you can control how many items execute per line (`-L`) as well as parallelism (`-P`). If you're not sure if it'll do the right thing, use `xargs echo` first. Also, `-I{}` is handy. Examples:
```bash
      find . -name '*.py' | xargs grep some_function
      cat hosts | xargs -I{} ssh root@{} hostname
```

- `pstree -p` is a helpful display of the process tree.

- Use `pgrep` and `pkill` to find or signal processes by name (`-f` is helpful).

- Know the various signals you can send processes. For example, to suspend a process, use `kill -STOP [pid]`. For the full list, see `man 7 signal`

- Use `nohup` or `disown` if you want a background process to keep running forever.

- Check what processes are listening via `netstat -lntp` or `ss -plat` (for TCP; add `-u` for UDP) or `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n` (which also works on macOS).

- See also `lsof` and `fuser` for open sockets and files.

- See `uptime` or `w` to know how long the system has been running.

- Use `alias` to create shortcuts for commonly used commands. For example, `alias ll='ls -latr'` creates a new alias `ll`.

- Save aliases, shell settings, and functions you commonly use in `~/.bashrc`, and [arrange for login shells to source it](http://superuser.com/a/183980/7106). This will make your setup available in all your shell sessions.

- Put the settings of environment variables as well as commands that should be executed when you login in `~/.bash_profile`. Separate configuration will be needed for shells you launch from graphical environment logins and `cron` jobs.

- Synchronize your configuration files (e.g. `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`) among various computers with Git.

- Understand that care is needed when variables and filenames include whitespace. Surround your Bash variables with quotes, e.g. `"$FOO"`. Prefer the `-0` or `-print0` options to enable null characters to delimit filenames, e.g. `locate -0 pattern | xargs -0 ls -al` or `find / -print0 -type d | xargs -0 ls -al`. To iterate on filenames containing whitespace in a for loop, set your IFS to be a newline only using `IFS=$'\n'`.

- In Bash scripts, use `set -x` (or the variant `set -v`, which logs raw input, including unexpanded variables and comments) for debugging output. Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use `set -e` to abort on errors (nonzero exit code). Use `set -u` to detect unset variable usages. Consider `set -o pipefail` too, to abort on errors within pipes (though read up on it more if you do, as this topic is a bit subtle). For more involved scripts, also use `trap` on EXIT or ERR. A useful habit is to start a script like this, which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:
```bash
      set -euo pipefail
      trap "echo 'error: Script failed: see failed command above'" ERR
```

- In Bash scripts, subshells (written with parentheses) are convenient ways to group commands. A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory, e.g.
```bash
      # do something in current dir
      (cd /some/other/dir && other-command)
      # continue in original dir
```

- In Bash, note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion. Checking a variable exists: `${name:?error message}`. For example, if a Bash script requires a single argument, just write `input_file=${1:?usage: $0 input_file}`. Using a default value if a variable is empty: `${name:-default}`. If you want to have an additional (optional) parameter added to the previous example, you can use something like `output_file=${2:-logfile}`. If `$2` is omitted and thus empty, `output_file` will be set to `logfile`. Arithmetic expansion: `i=$(( (i + 1) % 5 ))`. Sequences: `{1..10}`. Trimming of strings: `${var%suffix}` and `${var#prefix}`. For example if `var=foo.pdf`, then `echo ${var%.pdf}.txt` prints `foo.txt`.

- Brace expansion using `{`...`}` can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items.  This is helpful in examples like `mv foo.{txt,pdf} some-dir` (which moves both files), `cp somefile{,.bak}` (which expands to `cp somefile somefile.bak`) or `mkdir -p test-{a,b,c}/subtest-{1,2,3}` (which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree). Brace expansion is performed before any other expansion.

- The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and filename expansion. (For example, a range like `{1..20}` cannot be expressed with variables using `{$a..$b}`. Use `seq` or a `for` loop instead, e.g., `seq $a $b` or `for((i=a; i<=b; i++)); do ... ; done`.)

- The output of a command can be treated like a file via `<(some command)` (known as process substitution). For example, compare local `/etc/hosts` with a remote one:
```sh
      diff /etc/hosts <(ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts)
```

- When writing scripts you may want to put all of your code in curly braces. If the closing brace is missing, your script will be prevented from executing due to a syntax error. This makes sense when your script is going to be downloaded from the web, since it prevents partially downloaded scripts from executing:
```bash
{
      # Your code here
}
```

- A "here document" allows [redirection of multiple lines of input](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) as if from a file:
```
cat <<EOF
input
on multiple lines
EOF
```

- In Bash, redirect both standard output and standard error via: `some-command >logfile 2>&1` or `some-command &>logfile`. Often, to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input, tying it to the terminal you are in, it is also good practice to add `</dev/null`.

- Use `man ascii` for a good ASCII table, with hex and decimal values. For general encoding info, `man unicode`, `man utf-8`, and `man latin1` are helpful.

- Use `screen` or [`tmux`](https://tmux.github.io/) to multiplex the screen, especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session. `byobu` can enhance screen or tmux by providing more information and easier management. A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is [`dtach`](https://github.com/bogner/dtach).

- In ssh, knowing how to port tunnel with `-L` or `-D` (and occasionally `-R`) is useful, e.g. to access web sites from a remote server.

- It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration; for example, this `~/.ssh/config` contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments, uses compression (which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections), and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:
```
      TCPKeepAlive=yes
      ServerAliveInterval=15
      ServerAliveCountMax=6
      Compression=yes
      ControlMaster auto
      ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p
      ControlPersist yes
```

- A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care, e.g. per subnet or host or in trusted networks: `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `ForwardAgent=yes`

- Consider [`mosh`](https://mosh.org/) an alternative to ssh that uses UDP, avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road (requires server-side setup).

- To get the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for system configuration but not available in `ls` and easy to bungle, use something like
```sh
      stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/timezone
```

- For interactive selection of values from the output of another command, use [`percol`](https://github.com/mooz/percol) or [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

- For interaction with files based on the output of another command (like `git`), use `fpp` ([PathPicker](https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker)).

- For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777` (for port 7777 and Python 2) and `python -m http.server 7777` (for port 7777 and Python 3).

- For running a command as another user, use `sudo`. Defaults to running as root; use `-u` to specify another user. Use `-i` to login as that user (you will be asked for _your_ password).

- For switching the shell to another user, use `su username` or `su - username`. The latter with "-" gets an environment as if another user just logged in. Omitting the username defaults to root. You will be asked for the password _of the user you are switching to_.

- Know about the [128K limit](https://wiki.debian.org/CommonErrorMessages/ArgumentListTooLong) on command lines. This "Argument list too long" error is common when wildcard matching large numbers of files. (When this happens alternatives like `find` and `xargs` may help.)

- For a basic calculator (and of course access to Python in general), use the `python` interpreter. For example,
```
>>> 2+3
5
```


## Processing files and data

- To locate a file by name in the current directory, `find . -iname '*something*'` (or similar). To find a file anywhere by name, use `locate something` (but bear in mind `updatedb` may not have indexed recently created files).

- For general searching through source or data files, there are several options more advanced or faster than `grep -r`, including (in rough order from older to newer) [`ack`](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2), [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) ("the silver searcher"), and [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (ripgrep).

- To convert HTML to text: `lynx -dump -stdin`

- For Markdown, HTML, and all kinds of document conversion, try [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/). For example, to convert a Markdown document to Word format: `pandoc README.md --from markdown --to docx -o temp.docx`

- If you must handle XML, `xmlstarlet` is old but good.

- For JSON, use [`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/). For interactive use, also see [`jid`](https://github.com/simeji/jid) and [`jiq`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/jiq).

- For YAML, use [`shyaml`](https://github.com/0k/shyaml).

- For Excel or CSV files, [csvkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit) provides `in2csv`, `csvcut`, `csvjoin`, `csvgrep`, etc.

- For Amazon S3, [`s3cmd`](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) is convenient and [`s4cmd`](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd) is faster. Amazon's [`aws`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) and the improved [`saws`](https://github.com/donnemartin/saws) are essential for other AWS-related tasks.

- Know about `sort` and `uniq`, including uniq's `-u` and `-d` options -- see one-liners below. See also `comm`.

- Know about `cut`, `paste`, and `join` to manipulate text files. Many people use `cut` but forget about `join`.

- Know about `wc` to count newlines (`-l`), characters (`-m`), words (`-w`) and by
